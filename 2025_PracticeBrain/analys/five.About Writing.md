>>Neil
>>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil and…
>>
>>Finn
>>...I'm Finn. Today's programme is all about academic English.
>>
>>Neil
>>If you are going to study or you are studying 
>>at an English-speaking university, 
>>you might be wondering how you'll cope with 
>>understanding lectures and academic texts…
>>
>>Finn
>>…and writing essays.
>>
>>Neil
>>Yes. Academic English is different to 
>>the English people speak and write every day…
>>
>>Finn
>>It's more formal and uses higher level words. 
>>So in today's programme, 
>>we'll give you ideas for understanding >>words and phrases 
>>that you'll come across…
>>
>>Neil
>>…and some advice for writing essays and giving presentations.
>>
>>Finn 
>>We'll also give you tips for studying in English… 
>>But first, let's look at three main features of academic English: 
>>difficult English vocabulary...

>>Neil
>>…specialist subject vocabulary…
>>
>>Finn
>>…and language for organising essays and presentations.
>>
>>Neil
>>Now when you come across a word you don't know 
in an academic text or lecture, you can try to 
guess its meaning by looking at the context…
>>
>>Finn
>>…or by seeing if the word looks like a word in your own language.
>>
>>Neil
>>This is a particularly useful strategy 
>>if your own language has lots of words from Greek 
or Latin as many of the words used in academic English come 
from those languages. Words, for example, like microscopic, 
which means tiny, or analysis, which means study…
>>
>>Finn
…or regeneration, which means renewal.

>>Neil
>>Another strategy for working out the >>meaning is to look 
>>at how a word is constructed. Academic English words 
often have prefixes and suffixes.
>>
>>Finn
Remember, a prefix comes before the main part of 
the word and can change a word's meaning. For example, 
the prefix de, spelt d-e, means removing something, 
or reversing something.
>>
>>Neil
So, de-population means a reduction in the number of 
people somewhere, and de-forestation means clearing of 
trees from an area.

>>Finn
Suffixes are attached to the end of words.
A common suffix in English is -ise, spelt i-s-e. 
Examples of words with -ise are stablise, 
characterise and specialise. 
And these words are spelt with –ize in American English.
>>
>>Neil
That's right, they are. Now another common suffix is -ate, 
spelt a-t-e. Words with this suffix are differentiate and duplicate.
>>
>>Finn
Specialist subject words may also cause difficulty. 
Now you can help yourself in two ways: 
Firstly, prepare yourself before lectures. 
Find some texts on your subject, on the internet or 
in journals and magazines, 
and study the recurring specialist words in those texts.
>>
>>Neil
Yes, and to help yourself with this get hold of 
an English-English dictionary, 
and an English subject dictionary – for example of Medicine, 
or Law, or Linguistics.
>>
>>Finn
And secondly, listen to English radio and watch TV – 
now there are lots of specialist features which 
can help improve both your general and specialist English – 
and of course the BBC website has sections which 
have stories on technology, and science, and arts, which 
can also help.
>>
>>Neil
When writing your academic piece or giving a presentation, 
you will need to structure and organise your writing or 
presentation by using signposting language.
>>
>>Finn
You use signposts to indicate important parts of 
your essay such as stating its purpose, 
its structure, your views, the main points, 
and the direction of the argument 
and conclusions at the end as well.
>>
>>Neil
Linking words and phrases show connections between sentences and paragraphs.
>>
>>Finn
Yes, so Neil, let's give some examples of signposts. 
Firstly, for starting a piece of writing...
>>
>>Neil
The aim of this study is to…
This essay argues that…Finn
Yes. And how about for ending it…
>>
>>Neil
Finally…
In conclusion…
>>
>>Finn
And some examples of linking words and phrases are…Neil
First(ly), … second(ly), … finally, …
>>
>>Finn
And for adding something, you could write…Neil
In addition, … furthermore, …
>>
>>Finn
And if you want to show contrast, you might write…
>>
>>Neil
... however, … nevertheless, … on the other hand, …IDENT

>>Finn
And now for some tips for getting the best out of studying in English.
>>
>>Neil
OK, here's a good one. Have a study buddy – 
that's someone you can study with. 
You can test each other and support each other.
>>
>>Finn
And another one, set aside time for 
regular language study in addition to your academic study.
>>
>>Neil
Time for a quiz. Complete the sentences. 
Number one: Many words in academic English come from 
a) Latin words, 
b) American words or 
c) newspapers?
>>
>>Finn
It's a) Latin words. Now question two: A good way to start an essay is 
a) for example, 
b) in conclusion or 
c) this essay argues that?
>>
>>Neil
And it's c) this essay argues that.
>>
>>Finn
>>And the last question is: A good way to end an essay is 
a) on the other hand, 
b) in conclusion or 
c) this essay argues that?

>>Neil
And the answer is b) in conclusion.
